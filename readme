Introduction
Breast cancer is a complex disease, and understanding specific molecular alterations, such as HER2 amplification, is crucial for developing targeted therapies. This section reviews relevant literature on breast cancer and the role of HER2 amplification.

Methods
The analysis utilizes the TCGA- Invasive Breast Carcinoma PanCancer Atlas data from cbioportal. The script covers data preprocessing, including extraction and cleaning, and subsequent analyses such as differential expression, pathway enrichment, PCA, and gene expression clustering.

Results
Differential Expression Analysis HER2 Amplified and Not Amplified
The analysis identifies genes differentially expressed in HER2-amplified breast cancers compared to non-amplified cases.

Top 10 Differentially Expressed Genes Ranked by Fold Change
Discussion of the top 10 genes based on fold change and their potential biological significance.

Pathway Enrichment
Analysis of enriched pathways, with an emphasis on those associated with HER2 amplification.

PCA Plot
Visualization of principal components to explore the separation of samples based on ERBB2 amplification.

Gene Expression Cluster
Identification and visualization of gene expression clusters using hierarchical clustering and PCA.

Discussion
Summarization of key findings, interpretation of biological implications, alignment with existing literature, and addressing limitations and potential future directions.
